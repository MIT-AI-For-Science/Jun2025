# Missing Blog Post After Title Change (2025-04-20 07:40:52)

_**User**_

I changed a post title  to 2025-04-20 Schedule.md and it seem to have disappeared from the page where else should I make change ?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you investigate this issue. The problem might be related to how Jekyll (which appears to be your static site generator) processes post filenames and frontmatter. For Jekyll blog posts to be properly recognized and displayed, they need to follow a specific naming convention and have proper frontmatter.

Let me search for relevant files to help identify where changes might be needed.

I see the issue. The problem is with the filename format. In Jekyll, post filenames must follow this exact format:
- YYYY-MM-DD-title.md (with hyphens between words, no spaces)

Your current filename `2025-04-20 Schedule.md` has a space in it, which breaks Jekyll's post processing. Let me help you fix this:

1. First, let's read the current file to preserve its contents:

---

Read file: _posts/2025-04-20 Schedule.md

---

Now I'll help you fix this by:
1. Creating a new file with the correct naming convention
2. Deleting the old file

---

```diff
- 
+ ---
+ layout: post
+ title: MIT AI for Science June 2025 - Schedule
+ categories: Miscellaneous
+ ---
+ 
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. 
```

---

Now let's delete the old file:

---

Cancelled

I notice the file deletion was rejected, which might be due to permissions. You'll need to manually delete the old file `_posts/2025-04-20 Schedule.md` from your system.

Here's what I've done to fix the issue:
1. Created a new file with the correct Jekyll naming convention: `2025-04-20-schedule.md` (notice the hyphens instead of spaces)
2. Copied all the content from your original file to the new one

To complete the fix, you should:
1. Delete the old file `_posts/2025-04-20 Schedule.md`
2. Rebuild your Jekyll site

The post should now appear correctly in your archive page since:
1. The filename follows Jekyll's required YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format
2. The frontmatter (the YAML between --- marks) is properly formatted
3. The archive.md template is correctly set up to display posts

If you're still not seeing the post after these changes, you might need to:
1. Clear your Jekyll cache
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to rebuild your site
3. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

Would you like me to help you with any of these additional steps?

It looks like this now, I want to make this single page - like no need to click "read more" 

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to remove the "READ MORE" link and show the full content directly on the page. This behavior is typically controlled by the theme's layout files and how they handle post excerpts. Let me search for relevant layout files to make this change.

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "index.html _layouts home" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

Let me check the index.html file to see how posts are being displayed:

---

Read file: index.html

---

I see the issue. The current template is using `post.excerpt` and showing a "Read More" link. Let's modify the index.html file to show the full post content instead:

---

```diff
        </a>
        <div class="entry">
-         {{ post.excerpt }}
+         {{ post.content }}
        </div>
- 
-       <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" class="read-more">Read More</a>
      </article>
    {% endfor %}
```

---

I've made two key changes to the template:
1. Replaced `{{ post.excerpt }}` with `{{ post.content }}` to show the full post content
2. Removed the "Read More" link since it's no longer needed

Now your posts will show their full content directly on the home page without requiring users to click through to read more. You'll need to rebuild your Jekyll site to see these changes. You can do this by running:

---

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

```

```

It looks like Jekyll is already running on port 4000. You can view the changes by:

1. Opening your browser to `http://localhost:4000`
2. If you don't see the changes immediately, try doing a hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

The schedule page should now show the full content without any "Read More" link. Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

_**User**_

Is there a way to remove date from this page ?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I can help you remove the date from the page. Looking at the index.html file, I can see the date is being displayed through this line:

```html
<p class="post_date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}</p>
```

Let me modify the index.html file to remove the date:

Cancelled
