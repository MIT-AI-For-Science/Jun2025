# Improving GitHub Pages for MIT-AI-For-Science (2025-04-20 07:56:50)

_**User**_

I need help setting this up on GitHub Pages. There's organization "MIT-AI-For-Science"   
There's repo "Jun2025" - the current repo here,  I have permissions for both org and repo. 
The actual page here doesn't look good - Can you please help

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you improve your GitHub Pages setup. From the screenshots, I can see that your site is live at https://mit-ai-for-science.github.io/Jun2025/ but appears to be quite basic without proper styling.

Let me check what files we have in the repository to help improve the setup.

I see that you have a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages setup. Let me check your configuration files to help improve the appearance.

---

Read file: _config.yml

---

Let me check your Gemfile to see what theme and dependencies you're using:

---

Read file: Gemfile

---

Based on what I see, here are the issues and how to fix them:

1. **Theme Setup**: You don't have a theme explicitly specified. Let's use a proper Jekyll theme.

2. **Configuration Issues**: Your GitHub repository URL in the config is incorrect. It should be `MIT-AI-For-Science/Jun2025`.

3. **Base URL**: The baseurl setting might need adjustment.

Here's what you need to do to fix this:

1. First, update your `Gemfile` to include a theme. Create or modify it to look like this:

```ruby:Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "github-pages"
gem "jekyll-theme-minimal"
gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"
```

2. Update your `_config.yml` with these changes:

```yaml:_config.yml
# Theme setting
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal

# Update URL settings
url: "https://mit-ai-for-science.github.io"
baseurl: "/Jun2025"

# Update GitHub repository
github: MIT-AI-For-Science/Jun2025
```

3. Create a basic layout in `index.md` (replace your current index.html):

```markdown:index.md
---
layout: default
title: MIT AI for Science - June 2025
---

# MIT AI for Science

Welcome to the MIT AI for Science program - June 2025 cohort.

## AI for Scientific Discovery - Course Schedule

[View our course schedule](schedule)

```

4. After making these changes:
   - Commit all changes to your repository
   - Push to the `master` branch
   - Go to your repository settings → Pages
   - Ensure the source is set to "Deploy from a branch" and select the `master` branch
   - Save the settings

The site should rebuild automatically after these changes. The theme will provide a clean, professional look while maintaining the MIT branding.

Additional recommendations:

1. Add a proper logo in the `images` directory and update the avatar path in `_config.yml`
2. Create a `_pages` directory for additional content pages
3. Consider adding:
   - A course syllabus page
   - Contact information
   - Resources page
   - Student projects page

Would you like me to help you implement any of these additional recommendations or would you like to try the basic setup first to see how it looks?

I'm getting locally

I see you're getting a permissions error when trying to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` locally. This is happening because your system doesn't have write permissions for the `Gemfile.lock` file.

Here's how to fix this:

1. First, let's fix the permissions issue. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Change to your project directory (if not already there)
cd /Users/rashmi/Documents/2025/MIT_AI_Website/Jun2025

# Fix permissions for the Gemfile.lock
sudo chown -R $(whoami) .
chmod u+w Gemfile.lock
```

2. Then, run these commands to set up your local environment:

```bash
# Install bundler if you haven't already
gem install bundler

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start the local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

After running these commands, Jekyll should start serving your site locally at `http://localhost:4000/Jun2025/`

If you get any other errors after fixing the permissions, please share them and I'll help you resolve those as well. The local server is very helpful for previewing changes before pushing them to GitHub Pages.

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the local setup or the website configuration?
