Now this is what I see on my browser

_**Assistant**_

I see you're looking at the MIT AI for Science program website for the June 2025 cohort. The page appears to be quite minimal at the moment, showing:

1. The MIT logo and "MITAIforScience" header
2. A subtitle "MIT AI for Science - June 2025"
3. A main heading "MIT AI for Science"
4. A welcome message: "Welcome to the MIT AI for Science program - June 2025 cohort."
5. A section titled "AI for Scientific Discovery - Course Schedule" with a "View our course schedule" link

Let me check what files we have in the workspace to help understand the current setup.

I see this is a Jekyll-based website (based on the presence of `_config.yml`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, etc.). Let me check the main content file to see what we're working with.

Read file: index.md

This explains what we're seeing in the browser. The site is currently a basic Jekyll site with minimal content. Would you like me to:

1. Add more content to the homepage to make it more informative?
2. Create the course schedule page that's currently missing?
3. Add styling to make the site more visually appealing?
4. Something else?

Please let me know what aspects of the website you'd like me to help you improve!
