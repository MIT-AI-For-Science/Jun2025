# Viewing Jekyll GitHub Pages Locally (2025-04-20 07:04:07)

_**User**_

I just downloaded this Jekyll github pages template - how do I view it locally

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you set up and view your Jekyll site locally. First, I'll check the structure of your project to ensure we have the necessary files.

Let me check your Gemfile to see what dependencies are set up.

---

Read file: Gemfile

---

To view your Jekyll site locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. Since you're on macOS, Ruby should already be installed, but you might want to use a version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm` for better control.

2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
   This will install all the necessary gems specified in your Gemfile.

3. Once the installation is complete, you can start the local server by running:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. After the server starts, you can view your site by opening a web browser and navigating to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

If you encounter any issues:

- If you get a permission error during `bundle install`, you might need to use `sudo bundle install`
- If you haven't installed Bundler yet, you'll need to run `gem install bundler` first
- Make sure you're in the root directory of your project when running these commands

The server will automatically rebuild your site when you make changes to most files. However, if you modify `_config.yml`, you'll need to restart the server for changes to take effect.

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot if you encounter any specific issues while setting this up?

Now I want to customize this whole website - (1) it shows page as 127.0.0.1:4000 / reverie  - how do i just make it to root no /reverie

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you remove the "/reverie" from your base URL. This is typically controlled in the `_config.yml` file. Let me check its contents.

---

Read file: _config.yml

---

To remove the "/reverie" from your URL, you need to modify two settings in your `_config.yml` file:

1. Change the `baseurl` to be empty
2. Update the `url` to your actual domain (or localhost for local development)

Here's how the relevant sections should look:

```yml:_config.yml
# Your website URL (e.g. http://amitmerchant1990.github.io or http://www.amitmerchant.com)
# Used for Sitemap.xml and your RSS feed
url: "http://127.0.0.1:4000"

# If you're hosting your site at a Project repository on GitHub pages
# (http://yourusername.github.io/repository-name)
# and NOT your User repository (http://yourusername.github.io)
# then add in the baseurl here, like this: "/repository-name"
baseurl: ""
```

After making these changes:

1. Stop your Jekyll server if it's running (press Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Start it again with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Now you should be able to access your site at `http://127.0.0.1:4000` without the `/reverie` suffix

Note: When you eventually deploy this to GitHub Pages, you'll want to update the `url` to match your actual GitHub Pages URL or custom domain. For example:
- If you're using a custom domain: `url: "https://yourdomain.com"`
- If you're using GitHub Pages: `url: "https://yourusername.github.io"`

Would you like to make any other customizations to your website?

now it looks like attached image, I want to remove all the text from the page

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you want to remove all the sample blog posts from the homepage. These posts are likely stored in the `_posts` directory, which is where Jekyll keeps blog posts. Let me check that directory.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory _posts • **7** results</summary>

| 📄 `2019-8-12-code-snippets.md` |

</details>

To remove all the sample content from your site, you should:

1. Delete all the files in the `_posts` directory as these are the sample blog posts you're seeing
2. You can do this by deleting all the `.md` files in the `_posts` directory

After deleting these files:
1. Stop your Jekyll server if it's running (press Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` again
3. Your site should now show up without any of the sample blog posts

When you're ready to add your own content, you can create new `.md` files in the `_posts` directory following this naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md
```

For example: `2025-06-01-welcome-to-mit-ai.md`

Would you like me to help you create your first blog post or make any other customizations to the site?

Can I also remove all the top menu bar ?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we can remove the top menu bar. This is typically defined in either the header template or the navigation configuration. Let me check the relevant files.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory _includes • **6** results</summary>

| 📄 `analytics.html` |

| 📄 `meta.html` |

| 📄 `post.html` |

</details>

---

Let me check the default layout file since it likely contains the navigation structure:

---

Read file: _layouts/default.html

---

To remove the top menu bar, you'll need to modify the `_layouts/default.html` file. You can either:

1. Remove the entire navigation section, or
2. Remove just the menu items you don't want

Here's how the modified file should look with the navigation completely removed:

```html:_layouts/default.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% if page.title %}{{ page.title }} – {% endif %}{{ site.name }} – {{ site.description }}</title>
    {% seo title=false %}
    {% include meta.html %}

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/style.css" />
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="{{ site.name }} - {{ site.description }}" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml" />
    <link rel="canonical" href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}" />

    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/favicon-32x32.png">
    {% include analytics_head.html %}
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="bar"></div>
    <div class="wrapper-container">
      <div class="wrapper-masthead">
        <div class="container">
          <header class="masthead clearfix">
            <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" class="site-avatar"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.avatar }}" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></a>

            <div class="site-info">
              <h1 class="site-name"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">{{ site.name }}</a></h1>
              <p class="site-description">{{ site.description }}</p> 
            </div>
          </header>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wrapper-main">
        <div id="main" role="main" class="container">
          {{ content }}
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="wrapper-footer">
        <div class="container">
          <footer class="footer">
            {% include svg-icons.html %}
          </footer>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    {% include analytics.html %}
  </body>
</html>
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the entire `<nav>` section that contained the menu items

After making these changes:
1. Save the file
2. Restart your Jekyll server
3. The top navigation menu should now be gone

Would you like to make any other modifications to the layout? For example, we could also:
- Remove the footer
- Remove the site description
- Change the header styling
- Modify the site avatar
